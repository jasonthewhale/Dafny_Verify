I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the Dafny verifier is not recognizing the List datatype. In that case, we can use a sequence instead of a list. Here's the updated code:

```
method repeatValue<T>(d: T, n: nat) returns (result: seq<T>)
    ensures |result| == n
{
    result := [];
    var i := 0;
    while i < n
        invariant 0 <= i <= n
        invariant |result| == i
    {
        result := result + [d];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}
```
