The `AI_agent` directory also includes the chat logs from the COT process and the embedding vectors used for the model.

## Core files

- `chat_log`: This directory contains the chat logs generated during the COT process.

- `vector`: This directory contains the embedding vectors used for the AI model.

- `verify_examples`: This directory contains the validation examples to test effects of fine_tune.

- `compare_similarity.py`: This script implements the process to create embeddings for Dafny code.

- `fine_tune.py`: This script implements the fine-tuning process for the AI model.
